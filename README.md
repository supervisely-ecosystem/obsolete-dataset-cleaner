## Application Settings

### Select Workspace

Here you can choose one of:

 - all available workspaces for whose projects all datasets will be deleted

### Dataset Age

Set the number of days to determine how long ago the datasets were created, starting now.

### Sleep Time

Set the number of days the application will wait for the next cleaning iteration after the current one is complete.

### Additional Settings

Check the `One-time task` checkbox to run the application only once.
